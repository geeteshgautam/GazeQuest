# GazeQuest#An AI-based eye-tracking system is designed to capture, process, and analyze eye movements in real-time, providing precise gaze data that can be integrated into interactive virtual environments (IVEs). The system architecture consists of several key components, including sensors, data processing units, AI models, and an interface for embedding the system into IVEs. The design ensures low latency, high accuracy, and robust performance in diverse conditions.
